# Any SQL â€“ Jet Bridge App

In order to install **Jet Admin** on your project please follow this guide:  
[https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create](https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create)

This documentation contains only **Jet Bridge** step detailed description

Install **Jet Bridge** without additional software or services on any server or localhost. It will require you to install **Python** dependencies and run the application yourself.

#### Requirements

* **Python** 2.7 or 3.4+
* **pip -** package manager for Python
* Any of the following **SQL Databases**:
  * PostgreSQL 
  * MySQL 
  * SQLite 
  * Oracle 
  * Microsoft SQL Server 
  * Firebird 
  * Sybase
* **localhost** or **web server** with external IP

#### Installation

1. Install **Python** 2.7 or 3.4+ \(comes with **pip\)** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install **jet\_bridge** package using pip or update if you did it before using command line

```bash
pip install jet_bridge -U
# or for Python 3
pip3 install jet_bridge -U
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Windows** platform you need to specify **pip** full path and run command this way \(**pip** is stored in **Scripts** folder inside **Python**, path may be different in your case\):  
_C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts\pip.exe install jet\_bridge -U_
{% endhint %}

3. Install appropriate database adapter and libraries

```bash
# for PostgreSQL
pip install psycopg2
# for PostgreSQL + PosGIS
pip install GeoAlchemy2==0.6.2
pip install Shapely==1.6.4

# for MySQL
pip install mysqlclient
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Windows** and **MySQL** you may also need to install **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017:**

{% endhint %}

4. Run **Jet Bridge** with the command line as shown below:

```bash
jet_bridge 
```

If you run this command for the first time you will be asked to enter settings \(database host, port, etc.\) based on which a config file will be automatically generated. You can  edit this config file later.

After filling all required options config file will be generated and now you can run Jet Bridge by executing command once again:

```bash
jet_bridge 
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can read about all possible settings at [Configuration](../configuration.md) page.
{% endhint %}

5. You will see **Jet Admin** token in the console output which you should later enter on **Project Create page**. If you want to display **Jet Admin** token manually, use the following command:

```text
jet_bridge token
```

6. Finish your project installation by opening in your browser \(normally it should open automatically\): [**http://localhost:8888/api/register/**](http://localhost:8888/api/register/) where **localhost** is your **Jet Bridge** HOST and **8888** is its PORT. If you want to run Jet Bridge on different host/port you can configure it \(read more at [Configuration](https://docs.jetadmin.io/getting-started/configuration) page\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have **Jet** account yet you will be asked to create one and sign in with the existing account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
After registering your project you will be redirected to your project and can start working with **Jet**
