# Django framework â€“ Package

In order to integrate **Jet Admin** with your project using **SQL** database you need to install **Jet Bridge**. It will connect to your database and link **Jet Admin** with your project.   
It will work even with your local application on **localhost**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Jet Admin** for **Django** is a Python package installed with **pip** that integrates with your **models** and generates **API** interface through which **Jet Admin** can operate with your data. Though using this package is supported we recommend to use [standalone Jet Bridge](./#method-1-using-standalone-jet-bridge) as described before if possible.
