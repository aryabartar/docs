To integrate **Jet Admin** with your **Django** project you need to install the **Jet Bridge** package. It will work even with your local application on **localhost**.

[https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-django](https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-django)

This is the quickest way to install **Jet Admin** for Django based projects. Installed in the same way as most **Django** packages.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Jet Admin** for **Django** is a Python package installed with **pip** that integrates with your **models** and generates **API** interface through which **Jet Admin** can operate with your data. Though using this package is supported we recommend to use [standalone Jet Bridge](./#method-1-using-standalone-jet-bridge) as described before if possible.

#### Installation

1. Follow this guide to create project:  
[https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create](https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create)

2. Download and install latest version of **Jet Bridge** for **Django**:

```bash
pip install jet-django
```

3. Add `jet_django` application to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting inside **settings.py** file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  ...
  'jet_django',
  ...
)
```

4. Add URL-pattern to the **urls.py** file:

```python
urlpatterns = [
  ...
  path('jet_api/', include('jet_django.urls')),
  ...
]
```

If you use **Django &lt; 2.0:**

```python
urlpatterns = [
  ...
  url(r'^jet_api/', include('jet_django.urls')),
  ...
]
```

5. Apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate jet_django
```

6. Restart your project

7. You will see **Jet Admin** token in the console output which you should later enter on **Project Create** page. If you want to display **Jet Admin** token manually, use the following management command:

```bash
python manage.py jet_token
```

8. Finish your project installation by opening in your browser: [**http://localhost:8000/jet\_api/register/**](http://localhost:8000/jet_api/register/) where **localhost** is your **Django** HOST and **8000** is its PORT. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Jet Django** package sets **CORS** headers for **/jet\_api/** endpoints. If it conflicts with your **CORS** headers and you want to deal with it yourself, add the following in **settings.py**:   
JET\_CORS\_HEADERS = False
