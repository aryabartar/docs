# GraphQL

### 1. Add to Jet Admin

Create a new resource in Jet Admin, and select "GraphQL" as the _type_. Enter your API endpoint in the "Base URL" field. Depending on how authentication is set up for your API, you may need to enter URL parameters or headers, or set the method via the "Authentication" dropdown.
