# Connecting your resources

Jet Admin integrates with most data sources, such as PostgreSQL, internal APIs, Stripe, Firebase, SQLite, etc. Check out our continuously updating list of all supported resources here. 

You can add different resources simultaneously either on the welcome page that will pop up after you sign up or later on from Settings.

### 1.1 Adding a resource after sign up

Once you've signed up and created a project, you will be redirected to a page with all currently available resources:

### 1.2 Adding a resource from settings

To add a resource from Settings, go to your Profile → Settings → Resources. Connect a new resource by clicking the **+ Add Resource** button in the top right corner:
