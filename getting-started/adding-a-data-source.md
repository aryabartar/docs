# Connecting your resources

Jet Admin connects to most databases, like Postgres, internal API and 3rd party \(Stripe, Firebase, SQLite\)  etc..

You are able to add different resources simultaneously. There are two options for how you can do these:

1. First time adding resource 
2. Add resource from settings

### 1.1 Adding resource

After your first sign up and created project you can see different data sources.
