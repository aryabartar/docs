# Any SQL â€“ Deploy to Heroku

The simplest way to install **Jet Admin** is to deploy it to the **Heroku** cloud platform. It will require you to allow external access to your database.

#### Requirements

* Any of the following **SQL Databases**:
  * PostgreSQL 
  * MySQL 
  * SQLite 
  * Oracle 
  * Microsoft SQL Server 
  * Firebird 
  * Sybase
* SQL database installed on host with **external IP** and opened **port**

#### Installation

1. Follow this guide to create a project: [https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create](https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create)
2. Create an application on **Heroku** \(you will be asked to create an account if you don't have one already\)

   [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jet-admin/jet-bridge/tree/heroku)  
   Afterwards, you will be asked to specify the application name and database settings.

3. You will see the **Jet Admin** token in the console output which you should later enter on the **Project Create** page. If you want to display the **Jet Admin** token manually, use the following command: `jet_bridge token` 
4. Finish your project installation by opening this link in your browser: [**http://YOUR\_APP\_HOST/api/register/**](http://localhost:8888/api/register/) where **YOUR\_APP\_HOST** is your **Heroku Application** HOST.
