# Jet Admin User Guide

**Jet Admin** interface is generated automatically based on the structure of your data regardless of the technologies you use, and integration of your data with the interface happens within just a few hours. We created a visual editor through which the interface can be customized for any project without needing a developer.

This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating Jet Admin with out project and customizing it to fit your particular needs.

### What you can do with Jet
