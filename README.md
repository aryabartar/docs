* **Responsive Interface**

  Keep your admin panel up and running on all types of devices and screen resolutions with our responsive interface and iOS app.

## Extensibility

No matter how sophisticated the Jet interface is, sometimes basic features are just not enough to cover specific business operations. We understand that and made sure that you can always tailor the admin panel to your needs with Jet’s extendable components. 

Thanks to our **Flex features**, you can additionally customize your panel by coding your own Views, Fields, and Actions.

**Flex View.** Some processes are so complex, they require a custom widget solution. For instance, you might want to visualize the customer journey map in the form of a graph or a sidebar inside your admin panel. You can totally realize that in Jet! Thanks to our Flex View feature, you can code your own view into the admin’s interface using JS \(Angular, React\), HTML, and CSS. 

**Flex Field.** Say you want to merge first name and last name fields together or display a column from another Collection. You can do that by extending your interface with Flex Fields.

**Flex Action.** A Flex Action is a custom button inside Jet’s interface that allows you to realize your own business logic through an API request to your servers.
