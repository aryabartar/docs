# Release Notes

## November 6, 2019 – Multiple dashboards, the user activities log, and related record fields!

### Multiple Dashboards

You can now create several dashboards in your admin panel. For instance, your team can have separate dashboards for Sales, Marketing, Management, etc. 

What's more, all charts can be transferred from one dashboard to another in two clicks!

### Related Record Fields

Records in some collections can be linked to each other. For instance, if you're managing a mobility company, your Drivers records will most certainly be linked to Rides records.

It would be especially helpful to be able to add fields from one related record to another, so that you don't have to switch between those records and have all necessary information at-a-glance. With the new update, you can easily do that in the Visual Builder mode!

### Editing a Record in a Table View

We enabled record editing in a table view. To edit a record in your table, simply hover over a given column and click on the appeared pen icon.

### User Activities

We added an activity log to help you keep track of all changes made to any item in your admin panel. Go to Project Settings ⟶ User Activities and search for a specific modification.

As part of our ongoing effort to improve your experience with Jet Admin, we have updated installation for Docker, Heroku, Jet Bridge App, and Django. 

The installation time has been reduced and all previous issues have been fixed.
