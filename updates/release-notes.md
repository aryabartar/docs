# Release Notes

## November 6, 2019 – Multiple dashboards, the user activities log, and related record fields!

### Multiple Dashboards

You can now create several dashboards in your admin panel. For instance, your team can have separate dashboards for Sales, Marketing, Management, etc. 

What's more, all charts can be transferred from one dashboard to another in two clicks!

### Related Record Fields

Records in some collections can be linked to each other. For instance, if you're managing a mobility company, your Drivers records will most certainly be linked to Rides records.

It would be especially helpful to be able to add fields from one related record to another, so that you don't have to switch between those records and have all necessary information at-a-glance. With the new update, you can easily do that in the Visual Builder mode!

### Editing in a Collection View

We enabled table editing in a collection view. If you need to add or change some columns in your table, simply hover over this column and click on the appeared pen icon instead of entering the Visual Builder mode.

### User Activities

We added an User Activities Log to help you keep track of all changes made to any item in your admin panel. Go to Project Settings ⟶ User Activities and search for a specific modification.
