# Data privacy & Security

The main advantage of **Jet Admin** architecture is that absolutely no data transits over our servers. Users connect to their application data directly from their browser and **Jet Admin** is just there to allow them to display and interact with the data. 

**We don't get access to your private data**

To sum up **app.jetadmin.io** is just a frontend application that is downloaded from **Jet Admin** server and works only in your browser. It is an interface which works directly with application installed on your server \(Jet Bridge\) â€“ so the data is transmitted directly to your backend without our servers.
