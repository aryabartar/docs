# Actions

## What is an Action?

An action is a button inside the Jet Admin interface that triggers a function through an API request to your servers. 

## Native actions

Native actions are those available in your admin panel UI out-of-the-box. No single line of code is needed to enable them.

### CRUD

All CRUD operations are generated automatically based on your database structure. 

* **Create.** Add a new record to your collection by clicking the "Create" button in the top right corner of the collection view.

## Flex Actions

Flex Actions are a great way to perform **custom actions** on your data, such as refunding or banning a user. Flex Actions are developed with your own code and then integrated into the Jet Admin interface.
