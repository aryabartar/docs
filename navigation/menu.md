#### Side and Main Menu

By default all **Menu Items** are added to **Main menu** except default system links – Dashboard, Conversations, Search. But any **Menu Item** except Sections can be moved to **Side menu**.

### Menu item types

* **Link** – external link to particular URLs or link to some system pages inside **Jet Admin** \(Dashboard, Search, Conversations, etc.\)
* **Collection Link** – link to Collection List page, you should choose collection
* **Section** – used for grouping menu items, more about it [here](../browse/layout-editor.md#1-menu-group-menu-items-in-sections)

### Customizing

Displaying menu items, grouping them into sections, their ordering and other UI can be customized directly in **Jet Admin** interface.
