# Search

Sometimes you don't want to add filters to find something as it can be complicated and you just want to find some record by text containing in it. On top of each **Collection List** page there is always a **Search Bar** as on screen below. Just type in the **keyword** you want to search for and search will automatically filter and show you the records you are looking for. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Search** function will take your **keyword** and search it against each **text field** of all the records in this **Collection** and 1 level deep **Related** **Collections**.
{% endhint %}
