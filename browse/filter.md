# Filtering

If you want to find or select some records you can use filtering. **Jet Admin** offers a powerful filtering and search out of the box. 

### Adding filters

In order to filter records by some collection field \(i.e. name of restaurant contains "wabi"\) you need to add filter by one this ways:

* **\(1\)** – Add filter to a particular column \(collection field\) by clicking **Add filter** button next to column name \(will appear when you move mouse over column name\)
* **\(2\)** – Add filter to any collection field \(even not displaying as a column\) by clicking **Filter** button on the top right of the table

Depending on what way you are using – **\(1\)** or **\(2\)** – you will see **Add Filter Popup** as displayed below. To finish filter adding you have to:

1. Select field you want to filter – **only for \(2\)**
2. Select filter type: contains/starts with/etc. _Filter types are different for different type of data \(date/time/text/etc.\)_
3. Click **Filter** or **Exclude** button depending on how you want filter to apply _**Filter** will leave only those records that match your search criteria **Exclude** will hide records that match your search criteria_
